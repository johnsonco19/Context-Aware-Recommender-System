The database is in a zipped folder on teams called Database in Folder. Use pgAdmin4 to upload the database, it should work pretty smoothly from there. Be sure the password you use for you pgAdmin is the same as that listed in the main.py or otherwise change the main.py. Also make sure the database name is the same although I think that should be contained in the dump file.
